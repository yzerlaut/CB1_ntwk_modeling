# Modeling cortical network dynamics with CB1-mediated inhibition

## Results

We next analyzed the . To this prupose, we adapted previous model of th. in a conductance-based network model of 
Starting from an excitatory-inhibitory spiking network model of the cortical assembly (Zerlaut et al., 2019), we
